I feel deeply privileged to stand before you today at the graduation ceremony of one of the world’s greatest universities. I never completed college myself, so this moment is the closest I have ever come to attending a graduation. Today, I want to share just three stories from my life. Nothing extraordinary—just three simple stories.

Story One: Connecting the Dots

I left Reed College after only six months, but I continued attending classes informally for about a year and a half before finally leaving for good. Why did I drop out? The answer begins even before I was born.

My biological mother was young, unmarried, and a graduate student. She chose adoption for me but insisted I be adopted by college graduates. Initially, a lawyer and his wife were selected, but when I was born, they decided they wanted a girl instead. My adoptive parents, who were on a waiting list, received a late-night call asking if they wanted a baby boy. They immediately said yes.

Later, my biological mother discovered that my adoptive mother hadn’t finished college and my father hadn’t completed high school. She refused to finalize the adoption until my parents promised that I would one day attend college. Seventeen years later, I kept that promise.

However, I chose a college that was extremely expensive—almost as costly as Stanford. My parents used nearly all their life savings to pay my tuition. After six months, I felt lost. I didn’t know what I wanted to do, nor how college was helping me discover it. Spending my parents’ hard-earned money without clarity felt wrong, so I decided to leave.

It was frightening, but in hindsight, it was one of the best choices I ever made. Once I dropped out, I could stop attending mandatory classes I didn’t care about and instead sit in on subjects that genuinely interested me.

Life wasn’t easy. I slept on friends’ floors, collected empty soda bottles for food money, and walked miles every week just to get a proper meal. But I was happy. I followed my curiosity, and many things I learned then became incredibly valuable later.

One example is calligraphy. Reed College had exceptional calligraphy instruction. Every sign and poster on campus was beautifully handwritten. Since I was no longer bound by a fixed curriculum, I took a calligraphy class. I learned about fonts, spacing, and what makes typography visually pleasing. It was artistic and subtle—something science alone couldn’t explain—and I loved it.

At the time, it seemed useless for my future. But ten years later, while designing the first Macintosh computer, those lessons returned. The Mac became the first computer with elegant typography. If I had never taken that calligraphy class, computers might not have the rich fonts they do today. It wasn’t possible to see how the dots connected back then—but looking backward, everything made sense.

You can’t connect life’s dots looking forward. You can only understand them later. So you must trust that somehow, they will align in the future. Trust your instincts, fate, life—whatever you believe in. That trust has never failed me.

Story Two: Love and Loss

I was fortunate to discover what I loved doing early in life. At 20, Wozniak and I started Apple in my parents’ garage. Within a decade, Apple grew into a $2 billion company with over 4,000 employees. We had just launched the Macintosh, and I had turned 30—then I was fired.

As Apple expanded, we hired a leader to manage the company with me. Over time, our visions differed, and the board sided with him. Suddenly, I was out—very publicly. Losing the work that defined my adult life was devastating.

For months, I felt like a failure. I even considered leaving Silicon Valley entirely. But eventually, I realized something important: I still loved what I did. That passion hadn’t disappeared.

So I began again. Being fired turned out to be a gift. The weight of success was replaced by the freedom of starting fresh. It led to one of the most creative phases of my life.

I founded NeXT, started Pixar, and met the woman who became my wife. Pixar produced the first fully computer-animated movie, Toy Story, and became incredibly successful. Later, Apple acquired NeXT, bringing me back—and NeXT’s technology became central to Apple’s revival.

None of this would have happened if I hadn’t been fired. Sometimes life delivers harsh lessons, but they serve a purpose. The key is to love what you do. Your work will occupy a large part of your life, and true satisfaction comes from doing meaningful work you believe in. If you haven’t found that yet, keep searching. Don’t settle. When you find it, you’ll know—and it will grow stronger over time.

Story Three: Death

When I was 17, I read a quote: “If you live each day as if it were your last, someday you’ll be right.” Since then, every morning I ask myself: If today were the last day of my life, would I want to do what I’m about to do? When the answer is “no” for too long, I know something must change.

Remembering death helps strip away fear, ego, and expectations. It leaves only what truly matters. You have nothing to lose—so follow your heart.

A year ago, doctors found a tumor in my pancreas and told me I likely had only months to live. I was advised to prepare for death. Later tests revealed it was a rare, curable cancer. I had surgery and recovered.

Facing death changed my perspective. Death is unavoidable—and that’s okay. It makes room for the new. One day, all of us will be replaced. That’s life.

So don’t waste time living someone else’s life. Don’t let others’ opinions silence your inner voice. Have the courage to follow your heart—it already knows who you’re meant to be.

When I was young, a publication called The Whole Earth Catalog inspired my generation. Its final issue featured a photo of an open road and the words: “Stay Hungry. Stay Foolish.” That message has stayed with me ever since.

And now, as you step into the future, I pass those words on to you.

Stay hungry. Stay foolish.

Thank you.
